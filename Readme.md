What’s better now

Robust wake word flow: You can say “Jarvis start” to go active, “Jarvis sleep/stop” to pause, or just click the button.
Typed fallback: Use the input if your browser blocks the microphone.
Real weather: Uses Open‑Meteo (no API key), with city or your device location.
Smarter reminders/timers: Understands “tomorrow at 6 pm”, “in 15 minutes”, “on Monday 9am”, lists and clears.
Safer calculator: Sanitized math evaluation and clearer feedback.
Smarter web/open: Handles known sites, domains (e.g., google.com), or falls back to search.
Voice settings: Choose voice, pitch, rate, and volume; persisted between sessions.
Notifications and logs: Cleaner UI feedback; fixed notification “info” style.
Stability: Prevents recognition start loops and handles mic/permission/network errors gracefully.

Heads up

“Any task” is limited to what the browser allows (no OS-level control, no background always-on wake word in all browsers).
On iOS/Safari, auto-start and TTS may require a user gesture (click Activate Listening first).
